    "summary": "Beginning in 1941, based on global datasets collected over the following four decades by our former U.S. Chief Economic Analyst, a Harvard-educated economist, and our company founder, Edward R. Dewey, Foundation investigations revealed an unsuspected potential for planetary/solar causes that influenced over four thousand clearly identified \"cycles\", or \"non-chance\" rhythmic repetitive catalogued natural, social and economic events.\n\nSoftware development now in progress by our team of scientists and traders is revealing an incredible but rigorously mathematical explanation and validation for the truly unconventional concept that, as Dewey grew to suspect, hitherto unknown and unobserved astronomic dynamics cause, controls, and maintains these rhythms. \n\nThe Foundation has created a software based trading signal from these findings now being tested in live trading by the Barydyne Traders Group, a select international group of traders spanning the globe. \n\nI will be establishing a long-term sales/marketing strategy around the commercialization of this dynamic live real-time signal, which includes a product and technology roadmap. \n\nThe Foundation for the Study of Cycles possesses a greatly enhanced ability to forecast both pricing and trends of financial instruments such as equities, commodities, and the Forex market, with high reliability and repeatability. \n\nOur work presents a truly unprecedented game changer for all traders and investors. \n\nBy mapping this high accuracy \"technology of the future\" to enterprise and governments needs and requirements, our predictive analytics software suite will revolutionize and automate the decision-making process of events yet to come. \n\nCompanies that will employ our software suite will have a decisive competitive edge. \n\nWill your company be ready to compete - knowing your competition is using our look into your future…?",

It seemed they only wanted our money verses helping us to see our options. We couldn’t afford lots of advertising, but yet we wanted to grow. \n\nOUR HOPE\nOur thought to finding a solution was to find a lot of people willing to voluntarily share their knowledge, software and advice with us. The problem was that nobody was willing to share what they needed to make a living themselves.\n\nWE OVERCAME\nWe created an INDEPENDENT RESEARCH FACILITY for Residential Contractors. Its purpose is to share unbiased information on hundreds of different business strategies and tactics that other contractors are having success with in growing their business. Our ‘Case Studies’ webpage gives nice examples of how contractors benefit.\n\nNEW DAY\nBecause of our changed economy, new internet technologies and smarter younger competitors, contractors are being forced into a different mindset to attain higher, steadier incomes. \n\nBuilding a home requires hundreds of little steps to complete. Our team gives you peace of mind that you’re also doing everything possible in the office to achieve your dreams. Our efforts behind the scenes allow you to concentrate on doing what you do best.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNone of us are getting any younger …\nso the time to create a nest egg is quickly passing by.\n\nWe can’t promise to make you rich,\nor find you an endless supply of leads,\nor make all your problems magically go away …\nonly you can do that.\n\nWe can however, share the exact steps, technology and software\nof what other contractors are having success with.\n\nKnowing your options gives you better control.\nAre you open to a different approach?",

We received feedback from agencies & from the client side that finding the right candidates for their CX roles was difficult & time consuming. We offer a consultative approach, the more we understand about a company’s culture & ideals for Customer Experience & at what stage they are in achieving these ideals helps us to focus on the specific skills & experience that company needs. Once these have been agreed, we actively seek out candidates who meet those requirements'.\n\nWe saw that there was a need for both candidates with CX experience to be represented & assisted in their career progression in this area & also for businesses & their HR departments who have found it tough to source the right people. At CX Talent, we recognise that each company is at a different stage of development on their Customer Experience journey & dependent on where a business is on that journey from initial stages through to maturity & development, will decipher the type of candidate that that business really needs.\n\nCX Talent represents a growing team of exceptional candidates. We think creatively about your Customer Experience requirements & with our consultative approach, pair your company’s business needs with those people who have the relevant skills & experience to drive your business forward.\n\nCX Recruitment, Customer Experience Recruitment,",
